# Tests to run

- Seeing how many tags we need to create an accurate map?
- How various things that vary affect the overall mapping
    - Adding noise, etc.
    - Varying Y on odometry nodes
    - etc.

# TODOs:

Richard:
Documentation + validate_analogous_params

Rucha:
Getting delta + other metrics to show up easily without having to run everything

Ayush:
Connecting IDs to tags
